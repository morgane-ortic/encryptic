          <p>The year is 2077.</p>
          <p>The world is in shambles.</p>
          <p>
            We hacked important information from an oppressive mega-corporation.
            But now they're after us!
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to store that info safely until things calm down. But how?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide2">
          <img src="./img/intro-2.gif" alt="" />
          <p>
            Luckily, we're hackers! We can just use our Encryptator 4000 to
            encrypt and store our data, and make sure that only us can access
            it.
          </p>
          <p c>Here's how we can do it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide3">
          <img src="./img/intro-2.gif" alt="" />
          <p>
            First, let's register. We need to enter a user name and a password
            that will be stored to retrieve our data later.
          </p>
          <p>
            We don't encrypt the password directly, for safety, but hash it and
            store only its hash, unusable without knowing the password in clear.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide4">
          <img src="./img/intro-2.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            Then, let's enter our messages. They will be directly encrypted to
            be inaccessible to anyone who doesn't know our password, and stored
            with their creation date + time. F* you, megacorps!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide5">
          <img src="./img/intro-2.png" alt="" />
          <p></p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide6">
          <img src="./img/intro-2.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            Then, let's enter our message. It will be directly encrypted to be
            inaccessible to anyone who doesn't know our password, and stored
            with its creation date + time. F* you, megacorps!
          </p>
