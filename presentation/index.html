          <p>The year is 2077. The world is in shambles.</p>
          <p>
            We hacked important data from an oppressive mega-corporation. But
            now they're after us!
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to store that info safely until things calm down. But how?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide2">
          <img src="./img/intro-2.gif" alt="" />
          <p>
            Luckily, we're hackers! We can just use our Encryptator 4000 to
            encrypt and store our data, and make sure that only we can access
            it.
          </p>
          <p c>Here's how we can do it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide3">
          <img src="./img/register.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            First, let's register. We need to enter a user name and a password
            that will be stored to retrieve our data later.
          </p>
          <p>
            We don't store the password directly, for safety reasons, but hash it and
            store only its hash. It's a form of cryptography that will enable us to check our password without having to store it in clear.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide4">
          <img src="./img/message.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Then, let's enter messages containing our data. They will be
            directly encrypted to be inaccessible to anyone who doesn't know our
            password, and stored with their creation date + time.
          </p>
          <p>F* you, megacorps!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide5">
          <img src="./img/encryption.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Encryption worked! Our data is now safe. The corpo henchmen couldn't
            find anything!</p><p>But how can we retrieve it now?</p>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide6">
          <img src="./img/safe.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            We can log in with our username and password to access our new account on the cyber-darknet.
          </p>
          <p>Note that if a corpo-bootlicker tries to log in without our password, they'll be locked out.</p>
          <p>Once we're logged in we can see our messages again and when they were created. They will be imported from the data file and decrypted so we can read them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide7">
          <img src="./img/messages.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>We can also add another message to store with the others.</p>
          <p>And if someone is getting too close to our crypto-server, we can delete either single messages or our account with all the messages it contains.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide8">
          <img src="./img/hacker.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>Alright, we're set up! Enjoy your privacy and be safe out there!</p>
