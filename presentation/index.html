          <p>The year is 2077.</p>
          <p>The world is in shambles.</p>
          <p>
            We hacked important data from an oppressive mega-corporation. But
            now they're after us!
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to store that info safely until things calm down. But how?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide2">
          <img src="./img/intro-2.gif" alt="" />
          <p>
            Luckily, we're hackers! We can just use our Encryptator 4000 to
            encrypt and store our data, and make sure that only we can access
            it.
          </p>
          <p c>Here's how we can do it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide3">
          <img src="./img/register.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            First, let's register. We need to enter a user name and a password
            that will be stored to retrieve our data later.
          </p>
          <p>
            We don't store the password directly, for safety reasons, but hash it and
            store only its hash. It's a form of cryptography that will enable us to enter our password again without having to store it in clear.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide4">
          <img src="./img/message.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Then, let's enter messages containing our data. They will be
            directly encrypted to be inaccessible to anyone who doesn't know our
            password, and stored with their creation date + time.
          </p>
          <p>F* you, megacorps!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide5">
          <img src="./img/encryption.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Encryption worked! Our data is now safe. The corpo henchmen couldn't
            find anything!</p><p>But how can we retrieve it now?</p>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide6">
          <img src="./img/intro-2.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            Then, let's enter our message. It will be directly encrypted to be
            inaccessible to anyone who doesn't know our password, and stored
            with its creation date + time. F* you, megacorps!
